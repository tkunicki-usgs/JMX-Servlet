This project implements a JMX endpoint as a servlet for easy-to-configure access to a running servlet container. An additional module generates a VisualVM extension module providing the requierd jars on the classpath if one intends to use VisualVM as the JMX client.

Build then drop the war into your container and access JMX from a client with one of:

 service:jmx:burlap://<hostname>:<port>/jmx/burlap (XML based protocol)
 service:jmx:hessian://<hostname>:<port>/jmx/hessian (binary protocol)

Access points are authenticated using the tomcat manager credentials.

Communication *may not be encrypted* depending on your container configuration and how you access the endpoint.  Be careful with connections over insecure/public networks.

You must have the mx4j-tools (3.0.1) and hessian (3.0.8) jars in the classpath of your JMX client.  The associated visualvm project will build a module (.nbm) to install the required jars into VisualVM to access the JMX service endpoints.
